# Configuration

Tabularis is designed to work perfectly out-of-the-box, but offers extensive configuration options via the UI **Settings** panel and an underlying `config.json` file.

## Accessing Settings

Open the Settings panel from:
- **Sidebar**: Click the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar

## General Settings

- **Language Support**: Native translations for **English**, **Italian**, and **Spanish**. The app defaults to your OS locale. Changing the language requires a restart.
- **Update Checks**: Enable or disable automatic update checks on startup. Checks query the GitHub Releases API — no version data is sent, only a GET request is made.

## Storage Paths & config.json

Tabularis stores non-sensitive configuration, UI preferences, and connection metadata in a central `config.json`. **Passwords and SSH passphrases are NEVER stored here** — they live exclusively in your OS keychain.

### File Locations

| Platform | Path |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\tabularis\config.json` |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/tabularis/config.json` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/tabularis/config.json` |

### Manually Editing config.json

You can edit the file manually while **the application is closed**. Editing while Tabularis is running will likely result in your changes being overwritten when the app writes its state on exit.

A minimal valid `config.json` looks like:
```json
{
  "language": "auto",
  "fontSize": 14,
  "aiEnabled": false
}
```

Any key omitted from the file falls back to its default value. You do not need a complete file.

| `customRegistryUrl` | `string` | `null` | Custom URL for the plugin registry. Overrides the default official registry when fetching and installing plugins. |

## Application Logs

For debugging connection failures, plugin crashes, or unexpected behavior, Tabularis writes structured logs.

### Log File Locations

| Platform | Path |
| :--- | :--- |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Logs/tabularis/` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\tabularis\logs\` |
| **Linux** | `~/.cache/tabularis/` |

### Runtime Debug Logging

Launch Tabularis from the terminal with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable for real-time debug output:

```bash
# All debug messages from the Tabularis crate
RUST_LOG=tabularis=debug tabularis

# Debug messages from all crates (very verbose)
RUST_LOG=debug tabularis

# Only errors and warnings
RUST_LOG=warn tabularis
```

The `RUST_LOG` directive supports `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace` levels, with `info` being the default for production builds.

### What to Look for in Logs

When troubleshooting a connection issue, search the log file for entries related to the connection UUID:

```bash
grep "conn-" ~/Library/Logs/tabularis/tabularis.log | tail -50
```

SSH tunnel events are prefixed with `[ssh]`, database driver events with `[driver]`, and plugin events with `[plugin:<plugin-id>]`.

## Privacy & Telemetry

Tabularis is built with a strict zero-telemetry policy.

- **No analytics SDKs**: We do not embed Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Sentry (in production), or any third-party tracking library.
- **No crash reporting**: Panics are written to the local log file only. No automatic crash reports are sent anywhere.
- **No usage data**: Feature usage, query counts, session duration — none of this is tracked or transmitted.
- **Network requests made by Tabularis**:
  - Your configured database host(s)
  - `api.github.com/repos/debba/tabularis/releases/latest` (for update checks, if enabled)
  - Your chosen AI provider endpoint (only if AI is enabled and you trigger it)
  - Any URLs referenced in plugins you have installed

You can verify all outgoing network connections using `lsof -i` (macOS/Linux) or Resource Monitor (Windows) while the application runs.

## Resetting to Defaults

To reset all settings to factory defaults:
1. Close Tabularis completely.
2. Delete or rename the `config.json` file.
3. Relaunch Tabularis. A fresh `config.json` with all defaults will be created.

**Important**: This does NOT delete saved connections. Connection metadata is stored in a separate `connections.json` file in the same directory. To also remove connections, delete `connections.json`. Passwords stored in the OS keychain must be removed manually (via Keychain Access on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, or `secret-tool` on Linux).
